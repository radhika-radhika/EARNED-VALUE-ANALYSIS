# EARNED-VALUE-ANALYSIS

Earned Value Analysis (EVA) is a powerful project management technique used primarily in the field of Information Technology (IT) and across various other industries. It serves as a valuable tool for project managers and stakeholders to measure and evaluate the performance and progress of a project in terms of its cost and schedule. EVA provides a comprehensive and objective view of a project's health, helping project managers make informed decisions and take corrective actions as needed.

At its core, Earned Value Analysis integrates three key project performance metrics: Planned Value (PV), Earned Value (EV), and Actual Cost (AC). Here's a brief overview of these components:

1. Planned Value (PV): PV represents the authorized budget allocated for the work that was planned to be completed at a specific point in time, typically measured in time periods (e.g., weeks or months). It is also known as the Budgeted Cost of Work Scheduled (BCWS).

2. Earned Value (EV): EV represents the value of the work that has actually been completed at a given point in time, as per the project schedule. It is often referred to as the Budgeted Cost of Work Performed (BCWP).

3. Actual Cost (AC): AC is the actual cost incurred to complete the work up to a specific point in time. It includes all direct and indirect costs associated with the project and is also known as the Actual Cost of Work Performed (ACWP).

The comparison of these metrics helps project managers assess whether a project is on track, ahead of schedule, or behind schedule, and whether it is over or under budget. This evaluation is achieved through key performance indicators derived from the EVA formulae, such as:

- Cost Performance Index (CPI): CPI is a ratio of EV to AC, indicating whether the project is under or over budget. A CPI greater than 1 indicates cost efficiency, while a value less than 1 suggests cost overruns.

- Schedule Performance Index (SPI): SPI is a ratio of EV to PV, measuring whether the project is ahead of, behind, or on schedule. An SPI greater than 1 indicates schedule efficiency, while a value less than 1 suggests schedule delays.

- Cost Variance (CV) and Schedule Variance (SV): CV is the difference between EV and AC, while SV is the difference between EV and PV. These variances indicate the magnitude and direction of deviations from the budget and schedule, respectively.

- Percent scheduled for Completion (PSC):PSC, which stands for "Percent Scheduled Complete," is a crucial metric in project management. It represents the percentage of work or tasks within a project that has been completed relative to the project's planned schedule. PSC is a valuable tool for project managers and stakeholders as it provides insights into how well a project is progressing in terms of meeting its scheduled milestones and deadlines.

- Percent Complete(PC):PC represents the percentage of work completed on a specific task or activity within a project relative to the planned schedule. It serves as a vital indicator of how well a project is tracking against its original timeline. By calculating the PC, project managers can determine whether tasks are ahead of schedule (PC greater than 100%), on schedule (PC equals 100%), or behind schedule (PC less than 100%).
